<h2>Discussions Guidelines</h2>
<p>There is no regulation for speech because I want to encourage everyone to speak freely. Although, you'll be limited to GitHub's guidelines which will be enforced by Github, not me.</p>
<ol>
  <li>No Spamming: Any messages I see as spam will be deleted. I would like to keep these discussions clean and easy to navigate between relavent topcs.</li>
  <li>Relavent Topics Only: This is only a place to discuss Planetary Horizons. I have created a category where you can talk about whatever you want. Off topic conversations should go in that category. This is only to keep the discussions clean and help make it easy to find relavent content.</li>
  <li>No promotions: This is a place to discuss Planetary Horizons, not promote your apps, website, books, whatever your projects are. However, I will allow them to be mentioned if it connects to the conversation that is about Planetary Horizons. If you want to talk about your personal projects with the community, you can gladly do so in the off topic category.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not trying to regulate how you communicate, I created an off topic category to allow you to communicate however you want. These regulations are just set to help keep the discussions clean and help people find what they need.</p>
